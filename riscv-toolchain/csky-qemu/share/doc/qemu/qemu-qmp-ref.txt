1 API Reference
***************

1.1 Introduction
================

This document describes all commands currently supported by QMP.

Most of the time their usage is exactly the same as in the user Monitor,
this means that any other document which also describe commands (the
manpage, QEMU's manual, etc) can and should be consulted.

QMP has two types of commands: regular and query commands.  Regular
commands usually change the Virtual Machine's state someway, while query
commands just return information.  The sections below are divided
accordingly.

It's important to observe that all communication examples are formatted
in a reader-friendly way, so that they're easier to understand.
However, in real protocol usage, they're emitted as a single line.

Also, the following notation is used to denote data flow:

Example:

     -> data issued by the Client

     <- Server data response

Please, refer to the QMP specification (docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt) for
detailed information on the Server command and response formats.

1.2 Stability Considerations
============================

The current QMP command set (described in this file) may be useful for a
number of use cases, however it's limited and several commands have bad
defined semantics, specially with regard to command completion.

These problems are going to be solved incrementally in the next QEMU
releases and we're going to establish a deprecation policy for badly
defined commands.

If you're planning to adopt QMP, please observe the following:

  1. The deprecation policy will take effect and be documented soon,
     please check the documentation of each used command as soon as a
     new release of QEMU is available

  2. DO NOT rely on anything which is not explicit documented

  3. Errors, in special, are not documented.  Applications should NOT
     check for specific errors classes or data (it's strongly
     recommended to only check for the "error" key)

1.3 Common data types
=====================

 -- Enum: QapiErrorClass

     QEMU error classes

     Values:
     'GenericError'
          this is used for errors that don't require a specific error
          class.  This should be the default case for most errors
     'CommandNotFound'
          the requested command has not been found
     'DeviceNotActive'
          a device has failed to be become active
     'DeviceNotFound'
          the requested device has not been found
     'KVMMissingCap'
          the requested operation can't be fulfilled because a required
          KVM capability is missing

     Since: 1.2

 -- Enum: IoOperationType

     An enumeration of the I/O operation types

     Values:
     'read'

     Members:
     'host: string'
          host part of the address
     'port: string'
          port part of the address

 -- Object: InetSocketAddress

     Captures a socket address or address range in the Internet
     namespace.

     Members:
     'numeric: boolean' (optional)
          true if the host/port are guaranteed to be numeric, false if
          name resolution should be attempted.  Defaults to false.
          (Since 2.9)
     'to: int' (optional)
          If present, this is range of possible addresses, with port
          between 'port' and 'to'.
     'ipv4: boolean' (optional)
          whether to accept IPv4 addresses, default try both IPv4 and
          IPv6
     'ipv6: boolean' (optional)
          whether to accept IPv6 addresses, default try both IPv4 and
          IPv6
     The members of 'InetSocketAddressBase'

     Since: 1.3

 -- Object: UnixSocketAddress

     Captures a socket address in the local ("Unix socket") namespace.

     Members:
     'path: string'
          filesystem path to use

     Since: 1.3

 -- Object: VsockSocketAddress

     Captures a socket address in the vsock namespace.

     Members:
     'cid: string'
          unique host identifier
     'port: string'
          port

     Since: 2.8

 -- Object: SocketAddressLegacy

     Captures the address of a socket, which could also be a named file
     descriptor

     Members:
     'type'

     'data: InetSocketAddress' when 'type' is "inet"
     'data: UnixSocketAddress' when 'type' is "unix"
     'data: VsockSocketAddress' when 'type' is "vsock"
     'data: String' when 'type' is "fd"

     Note: This type is deprecated in favor of SocketAddress.  The
     difference between SocketAddressLegacy and SocketAddress is that
     the latter is a flat union rather than a simple union.  Flat is
     nicer because it avoids nesting on the wire, i.e.  that form has
     fewer {}.

     Since: 1.3

          decimal is for file descriptor number, otherwise a file
          descriptor name.  Named file descriptors are permitted in
          monitor commands, in combination with the 'getfd' command.
          Decimal file descriptors are permitted at startup or other
          contexts where no monitor context is active.

     Since: 2.9

 -- Object: SocketAddress

     'finish-migrate'
          guest is paused to finish the migration process
     'inmigrate'
          guest is paused waiting for an incoming migration.  Note that
          this state does not tell whether the machine will start at the
          end of the migration.  This depends on the command-line -S
          option and any invocation of 'stop' or 'cont' that has
          happened since QEMU was started.
     'internal-error'
          An internal error that prevents further guest execution has
          occurred

          the watchdog action is configured to pause and has been
          triggered
     'guest-panicked'
          guest has been panicked as a result of guest OS panic
     'colo'
          guest is paused to save/restore VM state under colo
          checkpoint, VM can not get into this state unless colo
          capability is enabled for migration.  (since 2.8)
     'preconfig'
          QEMU is paused before board specific init callback is
          executed.  The state is reachable only if the -preconfig CLI

     'host-ui'
          Reaction to a UI event, like window close
     'guest-shutdown'
          Guest shutdown/suspend request, via ACPI or other
          hardware-specific means
     'guest-reset'
          Guest reset request, and command line turns that into a
          shutdown
     'guest-panic'
          Guest panicked, and command line turns that into a shutdown
     'subsystem-reset'
          Partial guest reset that does not trigger QMP events and
          ignores -no-reboot.  This is useful for sanitizing hypercalls
          on s390 that are used during kexec/kdump/boot

                           "status": "running" } }

 -- Event: SHUTDOWN

     Emitted when the virtual machine has shut down, indicating that
     qemu is about to exit.

     Arguments:
     'guest: boolean'
          If true, the shutdown was triggered by a guest request (such
          as a guest-initiated ACPI shutdown request or other
          hardware-specific action) rather than a host request (such as
          sending qemu a SIGINT). (since 2.10)
     'reason: ShutdownCause'
          The 'ShutdownCause' which resulted in the SHUTDOWN. (since
          4.0)

     qemu will not exit, and a STOP event will eventually follow the
     SHUTDOWN event

 -- Event: RESET

     Emitted when the virtual machine is reset

     Arguments:
     'guest: boolean'
          If true, the reset was triggered by a guest request (such as a
          guest-initiated ACPI reboot request or other hardware-specific
          action) rather than a host request (such as the QMP command
          system_reset).  (since 2.10)
     'reason: ShutdownCause'
          The 'ShutdownCause' of the RESET. (since 4.0)

     Example:
          <- { "event": "SUSPEND",
               "timestamp": { "seconds": 1344456160, "microseconds": 309119 } }

 -- Event: SUSPEND_DISK

     Emitted when guest enters a hardware suspension state with data
     saved on disk, for example, S4 state, which is sometimes called

     Emitted when the watchdog device's timer is expired

     Arguments:
     'action: WatchdogAction'
          action that has been taken

     Note: If action is "reset", "shutdown", or "pause" the WATCHDOG
     event is followed respectively by the RESET, SHUTDOWN, or STOP
     events

     Note: This event is rate-limited.

     Since: 0.13.0

     Example:
          <- { "event": "WATCHDOG",

1.7 Block devices
=================

1.7.1 Block core (VM unrelated)
-------------------------------

1.7.2 Background jobs
---------------------

 -- Enum: JobType

     Type of a background job.

     Values:
     'commit'
          block commit job type, see "block-commit"
     'stream'
          block stream job type, see "block-stream"

          drive backup job type, see "drive-backup"
     'create'
          image creation job type, see "blockdev-create" (since 3.0)

     Since: 1.7

 -- Enum: JobStatus

     Indicates the present state of a given job in its lifetime.

     Values:
     'undefined'
          Erroneous, default state.  Should not ever be visible.
     'created'
          The job has been created, but not yet started.
     'running'
          The job is currently running.
     'paused'
          The job is running, but paused.  The pause may be requested by
          either the QMP user or by internal processes.
     'ready'
          The job is running, but is ready for the user to signal
          completion.  This is used for long-running jobs like mirror
          that are designed to run indefinitely.
     'standby'
          The job is ready, but paused.  This is nearly identical to
          'paused'.  The job may return to 'ready' or otherwise be
          canceled.
     'waiting'
          The job is waiting for other jobs in the transaction to
          converge to the waiting state.  This status will likely not be
          visible for the last job in a transaction.
     'pending'
          The job has finished its work, but has finalization steps that
          it needs to make prior to completing.  These changes will
          require manual intervention via 'job-finalize' if
          auto-finalize was set to false.  These pending changes may
          still fail.
     'aborting'
          The job is in the process of being aborted, and will finish
          with an error.  The job will afterwards report that it is
          'concluded'.  This status may not be visible to the management
          process.
     'concluded'
          The job has finished all work.  If auto-dismiss was set to
          false, the job will remain in the query list until it is
          dismissed via 'job-dismiss'.
     'null'
          The job is in the process of being dismantled.  This state
          should not ever be visible externally.

     Since: 2.12

 -- Event: JOB_STATUS_CHANGE

     Emitted when a job transitions to a different status.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier
     'status: JobStatus'
          The new job status

     Since: 3.0

 -- Command: job-pause

     Pause an active job.

     This command returns immediately after marking the active job for
     pausing.  Pausing an already paused job is an error.

     The job will pause as soon as possible, which means transitioning
     into the PAUSED state if it was RUNNING, or into STANDBY if it was
     READY. The corresponding JOB_STATUS_CHANGE event will be emitted.

     Cancelling a paused job automatically resumes it.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier.

     Since: 3.0

 -- Command: job-resume

     Resume a paused job.

     This command returns immediately after resuming a paused job.
     Resuming an already running job is an error.

     'id' : The job identifier.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          Not documented

     Since: 3.0

 -- Command: job-cancel

     Instruct an active background job to cancel at the next
     opportunity.  This command returns immediately after marking the
     active job for cancellation.

     The job will cancel as soon as possible and then emit a
     JOB_STATUS_CHANGE event.  Usually, the status will change to
     ABORTING, but it is possible that a job successfully completes
     (e.g.  because it was almost done and there was no opportunity to
     cancel earlier than completing the job) and transitions to PENDING
     instead.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier.

     Since: 3.0

 -- Command: job-complete

     Manually trigger completion of an active job in the READY state.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier.

     Since: 3.0

 -- Command: job-dismiss

     Deletes a job that is in the CONCLUDED state.  This command only
     needs to be run explicitly for jobs that don't have automatic
     dismiss enabled.

     This command will refuse to operate on any job that has not yet
     reached its terminal state, JOB_STATUS_CONCLUDED. For jobs that
     make use of JOB_READY event, job-cancel or job-complete will still
     need to be used as appropriate.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier.

     Since: 3.0

 -- Command: job-finalize

     Instructs all jobs in a transaction (or a single job if it is not
     part of any transaction) to finalize any graph changes and do any
     necessary cleanup.  This command requires that all involved jobs
     are in the PENDING state.

     For jobs in a transaction, instructing one job to finalize will
     force ALL jobs in the transaction to finalize, so it is only
     necessary to instruct a single member job to finalize.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The identifier of any job in the transaction, or of a job that
          is not part of any transaction.

     Since: 3.0

 -- Object: JobInfo

     Information about a job.

     Members:
     'id: string'

     'type: JobType'
          The kind of job that is being performed
     'status: JobStatus'
          Current job state/status
     'current-progress: int'
          Progress made until now.  The unit is arbitrary and the value
          can only meaningfully be used for the ratio of
          'current-progress' to 'total-progress'.  The value is
          monotonically increasing.
     'total-progress: int'
          Estimated 'current-progress' value at the completion of the
          job.  This value can arbitrarily change while the job is
          running, in both directions.
     'error: string' (optional)
          If this field is present, the job failed; if it is still
          missing in the CONCLUDED state, this indicates successful
          completion.

          The value is a human-readable error message to describe the
          reason for the job failure.  It should not be parsed by
          applications.

 -- Enum: DirtyBitmapStatus

     An enumeration of possible states that a dirty bitmap can report to
     the user.

     Values:
     'frozen'
          The bitmap is currently in-use by some operation and is
          immutable.  If the bitmap was 'active' prior to the operation,
          new writes by the guest are being recorded in a temporary
          buffer, and will not be lost.  Generally, bitmaps are cleared
          on successful use in an operation and the temporary buffer is
          committed into the bitmap.  On failure, the temporary buffer
          is merged back into the bitmap without first clearing it.
          Please refer to the documentation for each bitmap-using
          operation, See also 'blockdev-backup', 'drive-backup'.
     'disabled'
          The bitmap is not currently recording new writes by the guest.
          This is requested explicitly via 'block-dirty-bitmap-disable'.
          It can still be cleared, deleted, or used for backup
          operations.
     'active'
          The bitmap is actively monitoring for new writes, and can be
          cleared, deleted, or used for backup operations.
     'locked'
          The bitmap is currently in-use by some operation and is
          immutable.  If the bitmap was 'active' prior to the operation,
          it is still recording new writes.  If the bitmap was
          'disabled', it is not recording new writes.  (Since 2.12)
     'inconsistent'
          This is a persistent dirty bitmap that was marked in-use on
          disk, and is unusable by QEMU. It can only be deleted.  Please
          rely on the inconsistent field in 'BlockDirtyInfo' instead, as
          the status field is deprecated.  (Since 4.0)

          Replaces 'active' and 'disabled' statuses.  (since 4.0)
     'busy: boolean'
          true if the bitmap is in-use by some operation (NBD or jobs)
          and cannot be modified via QMP or used by another operation.
          Replaces 'locked' and 'frozen' statuses.  (since 4.0)
     'persistent: boolean'
          true if the bitmap was stored on disk, is scheduled to be
          stored on disk, or both.  (since 4.0)
     'inconsistent: boolean' (optional)
          true if this is a persistent bitmap that was improperly
          stored.  Implies 'persistent' to be true; 'recording' and
          'busy' to be false.  This bitmap cannot be used.  To remove
          it, use 'block-dirty-bitmap-remove'.  (Since 4.0)

 -- Enum: Qcow2BitmapInfoFlags

     An enumeration of flags that a bitmap can report to the user.

     Values:
     'in-use'
          This flag is set by any process actively modifying the qcow2
          file, and cleared when the updated bitmap is flushed to the
          qcow2 image.  The presence of this flag in an offline image
          means that the bitmap was not saved correctly after its last
          usage, and may contain inconsistent data.
     'auto'
          The bitmap must reflect all changes of the virtual disk by any
          application that would write to this qcow2 file.

     'bins: array of int'
          list of io request counts corresponding to histogram
          intervals.  len('bins') = len('boundaries') + 1 For the
          example above, 'bins' may be something like [3, 1, 5, 2], and
          corresponding histogram looks like:

     latency histograms.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The name or QOM path of the guest device.
     'boundaries: array of int' (optional)
          list of interval boundary values (see description in
          BlockLatencyHistogramInfo definition).  If specified, all
          latency histograms are removed, and empty ones created for all
          io types with intervals corresponding to 'boundaries' (except
          for io types, for which specific boundaries are set through
          the following parameters).
     'boundaries-read: array of int' (optional)
          list of interval boundary values for read latency histogram.
          If specified, old read latency histogram is removed, and empty
          one created with intervals corresponding to 'boundaries-read'.

 -- Object: BlockMeasureInfo

     Image file size calculation information.  This structure describes
     the size requirements for creating a new image file.

     The size requirements depend on the new image file format.  File
     size always equals virtual disk size for the 'raw' format, even for
     sparse POSIX files.  Compact formats such as 'qcow2' represent
     unallocated and zero regions efficiently so file size may be
     smaller than virtual disk size.

     The values are upper bounds that are guaranteed to fit the new
     image file.  Subsequent modification, such as internal snapshot or
     bitmap creation, may require additional space and is not covered
     here.

     Members:
     'required: int'
          Size required for a new image file, in bytes.
     'fully-allocated: int'
          Image file size, in bytes, once data has been written to all

 -- Command: query-blockstats

     Query the 'BlockStats' for all virtual block devices.

     Arguments:
     'query-nodes: boolean' (optional)
          If true, the command will query all the block nodes that have
          a node name, in a list which will include "parent"
          information, but not "backing".  If false or omitted, the
          behavior is as before - query all the device backends,
          recursively including their "parent" and "backing".  Filter
          nodes that were created implicitly are skipped over in this
          mode.  (Since 2.3)

     Returns: A list of 'BlockStats' for each virtual block devices.

          same as 'stop' on ENOSPC, same as 'report' otherwise.
     'stop'
          for guest operations, stop the virtual machine; for jobs,
          pause the job

          created.
     'format: string' (optional)
          the format of the new destination, default is to probe if
          'mode' is 'existing', else the format of the source

     'auto-finalize: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
          finished its work, waiting for 'block-job-finalize' before
          making any block graph changes.  When true, this job will

          to true.  (Since 2.12)
     'auto-dismiss: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a CONCLUDED state after it

          disappear from the query list without user intervention.
          Defaults to true.  (Since 2.12)

     Note: 'on-source-error' and 'on-target-error' only affect

 -- Command: blockdev-snapshot-sync

     Takes a synchronous snapshot of a block device.

     For the arguments, see the documentation of BlockdevSnapshotSync.

     Returns: nothing on success If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-snapshot-sync",
               "arguments": { "device": "ide-hd0",
                              "snapshot-file":
                              "/some/place/my-image",
                              "format": "qcow2" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: blockdev-snapshot

     Takes a snapshot of a block device.

     Take a snapshot, by installing 'node' as the backing image of
     'overlay'.  Additionally, if 'node' is associated with a block
     device, the block device changes to using 'overlay' as its new
     active image.

     For the arguments, see the documentation of BlockdevSnapshot.

     Since: 2.5

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-add",
               "arguments": { "driver": "qcow2",
                              "node-name": "node1534",
                              "file": { "driver": "file",

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: change-backing-file

     Change the backing file in the image file metadata.  This does not
     cause QEMU to reopen the image file to reparse the backing filename
     (it may, however, perform a reopen to change permissions from r/o
     -> r/w -> r/o, if needed).  The new backing file string is written
     into the image file metadata, and the QEMU internal strings are
     updated.

     Arguments:
     'image-node-name: string'
          The name of the block driver state node of the image to
          modify.  The "device" argument is used to verify
          "image-node-name" is in the chain described by "device".
     'device: string'
          The device name or node-name of the root node that owns
          image-node-name.
     'backing-file: string'
          The string to write as the backing file.  This string is not
          validated, so care should be taken when specifying the string
          or the image chain may not be able to be reopened again.

     Returns: Nothing on success

     If "device" does not exist or cannot be determined, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 2.1

 -- Command: block-commit

     Live commit of data from overlay image nodes into backing nodes -
     i.e., writes data between 'top' and 'base' into 'base'.

     Arguments:
     'job-id: string' (optional)
          identifier for the newly-created block job.  If omitted, the
          device name will be used.  (Since 2.7)
     'device: string'
          the device name or node-name of a root node
     'base-node: string' (optional)
          The node name of the backing image to write data into.  If not
          specified, this is the deepest backing image.  (since: 3.1)
     'base: string' (optional)
          Same as 'base-node', except that it is a file name rather than
          a node name.  This must be the exact filename string that was
          used to open the node; other strings, even if addressing the
          same file, are not accepted (deprecated, use 'base-node'
          instead)
     'top-node: string' (optional)
          The node name of the backing image within the image chain
          which contains the topmost data to be committed down.  If not
          specified, this is the active layer.  (since: 3.1)
     'top: string' (optional)
          Same as 'top-node', except that it is a file name rather than
          a node name.  This must be the exact filename string that was
          used to open the node; other strings, even if addressing the
          same file, are not accepted (deprecated, use 'base-node'
          instead)
     'backing-file: string' (optional)
          The backing file string to write into the overlay image of
          'top'.  If 'top' is the active layer, specifying a backing
          file string is an error.  This filename is not validated.

          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be resolved by
          QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or HMP commands must use
          node-names for the image in question, as filename lookup
          methods will fail.

          If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine the
          backing file string to use, or error out if there is no
          obvious choice.  Care should be taken when specifying the
          string, to specify a valid filename or protocol.  (Since 2.1)

          If top == base, that is an error.  If top == active, the job
          will not be completed by itself, user needs to complete the
          job with the block-job-complete command after getting the
          ready event.  (Since 2.0)

          If the base image is smaller than top, then the base image
          will be resized to be the same size as top.  If top is smaller
          than the base image, the base will not be truncated.  If you
          want the base image size to match the size of the smaller top,
          you can safely truncate it yourself once the commit operation
          successfully completes.
     'speed: int' (optional)
          the maximum speed, in bytes per second
     'filter-node-name: string' (optional)
          the node name that should be assigned to the filter driver
          that the commit job inserts into the graph above 'top'.  If
          this option is not given, a node name is autogenerated.
          (Since: 2.9)
     'auto-finalize: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
          finished its work, waiting for 'block-job-finalize' before
          making any block graph changes.  When true, this job will
          automatically perform its abort or commit actions.  Defaults
          to true.  (Since 3.1)
     'auto-dismiss: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a CONCLUDED state after it
          has completely ceased all work, and awaits
          'block-job-dismiss'.  When true, this job will automatically
          disappear from the query list without user intervention.
          Defaults to true.  (Since 3.1)

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'device' does not exist,
     DeviceNotFound Any other error returns a GenericError.

 -- Command: drive-backup

     Start a point-in-time copy of a block device to a new destination.
     The status of ongoing drive-backup operations can be checked with

 -- Object: XDbgBlockGraphNode

     Members:
     'id: int'

          identifiers in Qemu.
     'type: XDbgBlockGraphNodeType'
          Type of graph node.  Can be one of block-backend, block-job or
          block-driver-state.
     'name: string'
          Human readable name of the node.  Corresponds to node-name for

          the whole graph (with block-jobs and block-backends).

 -- Enum: BlockPermission

     Enum of base block permissions.

     Values:
     'consistent-read'
          A user that has the "permission" of consistent reads is
          guaranteed that their view of the contents of the block device
          is complete and self-consistent, representing the contents of
          a disk at a specific point.  For most block devices (including
          their backing files) this is true, but the property cannot be
          maintained in a few situations like for intermediate nodes of
          a commit block job.
     'write'
          This permission is required to change the visible disk
          contents.
     'write-unchanged'
          This permission (which is weaker than BLK_PERM_WRITE) is both
          enough and required for writes to the block node when the
          caller promises that the visible disk content doesn't change.
          As the BLK_PERM_WRITE permission is strictly stronger, either
          is sufficient to perform an unchanging write.
     'resize'
          This permission is required to change the size of a block
          node.
     'graph-mod'
          This permission is required to change the node that this
          BdrvChild points to.

          the format of the new destination, default is to probe if
          'mode' is 'existing', else the format of the source

     'granularity: int' (optional)
          granularity of the dirty bitmap, default is 64K if the image
          format doesn't have clusters, 4K if the clusters are smaller

 -- Command: block-dirty-bitmap-merge

     Merge dirty bitmaps listed in 'bitmaps' to the 'target' dirty
     bitmap.  Dirty bitmaps in 'bitmaps' will be unchanged, except if it
     also appears as the 'target' bitmap.  Any bits already set in
     'target' will still be set after the merge, i.e., this operation
     does not clear the target.  On error, 'target' is unchanged.

     The resulting bitmap will count as dirty any clusters that were
     dirty in any of the source bitmaps.  This can be used to achieve
     backup checkpoints, or in simpler usages, to copy bitmaps.

     Returns: nothing on success If 'node' is not a valid block device,

          that the mirror job inserts into the graph above 'device'.  If
          this option is not given, a node name is autogenerated.
          (Since: 2.9)
     'copy-mode: MirrorCopyMode' (optional)
          when to copy data to the destination; defaults to 'background'
          (Since: 3.0)
     'auto-finalize: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
          finished its work, waiting for 'block-job-finalize' before
          making any block graph changes.  When true, this job will
          automatically perform its abort or commit actions.  Defaults
          to true.  (Since 3.1)
     'auto-dismiss: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a CONCLUDED state after it
          has completely ceased all work, and awaits
          'block-job-dismiss'.  When true, this job will automatically
          disappear from the query list without user intervention.
          Defaults to true.  (Since 3.1)

     Returns: nothing on success.

     Since: 2.6

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-mirror",
               "arguments": { "device": "ide-hd0",
                              "target": "target0",
                              "sync": "full" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: block_set_io_throttle

     Change I/O throttle limits for a block drive.

     Since QEMU 2.4, each device with I/O limits is member of a throttle
     group.

     If two or more devices are members of the same group, the limits
     will apply to the combined I/O of the whole group in a round-robin
     fashion.  Therefore, setting new I/O limits to a device will affect
     the whole group.

     The name of the group can be specified using the 'group' parameter.
     If the parameter is unset, it is assumed to be the current group of
     that device.  If it's not in any group yet, the name of the device
     will be used as the name for its group.

     The 'group' parameter can also be used to move a device to a
     different group.  In this case the limits specified in the
     parameters will be applied to the new group only.

     I/O limits can be disabled by setting all of them to 0.  In this
     case the device will be removed from its group and the rest of its
     members will not be affected.  The 'group' parameter is ignored.

     Arguments: the members of 'BlockIOThrottle'

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, DeviceNotFound

 -- Command: block-stream

     Copy data from a backing file into a block device.

     The block streaming operation is performed in the background until
     the entire backing file has been copied.  This command returns
     immediately once streaming has started.  The status of ongoing
     block streaming operations can be checked with query-block-jobs.
     The operation can be stopped before it has completed using the
     block-job-cancel command.

     The node that receives the data is called the top image, can be
     located in any part of the chain (but always above the base image;
     see below) and can be specified using its device or node name.
     Earlier qemu versions only allowed 'device' to name the top level
     node; presence of the 'base-node' parameter during introspection
     can be used as a witness of the enhanced semantics of 'device'.

     If a base file is specified then sectors are not copied from that
     base file and its backing chain.  When streaming completes the
     image file will have the base file as its backing file.  This can
     be used to stream a subset of the backing file chain instead of
     flattening the entire image.

     On successful completion the image file is updated to drop the
     backing file and the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is emitted.

     Arguments:
     'job-id: string' (optional)
          identifier for the newly-created block job.  If omitted, the
          device name will be used.  (Since 2.7)
     'device: string'
          the device or node name of the top image
     'base: string' (optional)
          the common backing file name.  It cannot be set if 'base-node'
          is also set.
     'base-node: string' (optional)
          the node name of the backing file.  It cannot be set if 'base'
          is also set.  (Since 2.8)
     'backing-file: string' (optional)
          The backing file string to write into the top image.  This
          filename is not validated.

          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be resolved by
          QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or HMP commands must use
          node-names for the image in question, as filename lookup
          methods will fail.

          If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine the
          backing file string to use, or error out if there is no
          obvious choice.  Care should be taken when specifying the
          string, to specify a valid filename or protocol.  (Since 2.1)
     'speed: int' (optional)
          the maximum speed, in bytes per second
     'on-error: BlockdevOnError' (optional)
          the action to take on an error (default report).  'stop' and
          'enospc' can only be used if the block device supports
          io-status (see BlockInfo).  Since 1.3.
     'auto-finalize: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a PENDING state after it has
          finished its work, waiting for 'block-job-finalize' before
          making any block graph changes.  When true, this job will
          automatically perform its abort or commit actions.  Defaults
          to true.  (Since 3.1)
     'auto-dismiss: boolean' (optional)
          When false, this job will wait in a CONCLUDED state after it
          has completely ceased all work, and awaits
          'block-job-dismiss'.  When true, this job will automatically
          disappear from the query list without user intervention.
          Defaults to true.  (Since 3.1)

     Returns: Nothing on success.  If 'device' does not exist,
     DeviceNotFound.

     Since: 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "block-stream",
               "arguments": { "device": "virtio0",
                              "base": "/tmp/master.qcow2" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: block-job-set-speed

     Set maximum speed for a background block operation.

     This command can only be issued when there is an active block job.

     Throttling can be disabled by setting the speed to 0.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.
     'speed: int'
          the maximum speed, in bytes per second, or 0 for unlimited.
          Defaults to 0.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: block-job-cancel

     Stop an active background block operation.

     This command returns immediately after marking the active
     background block operation for cancellation.  It is an error to
     call this command if no operation is in progress.

     The operation will cancel as soon as possible and then emit the
     BLOCK_JOB_CANCELLED event.  Before that happens the job is still
     visible when enumerated using query-block-jobs.

     Note that if you issue 'block-job-cancel' after 'drive-mirror' has
     indicated (via the event BLOCK_JOB_READY) that the source and
     destination are synchronized, then the event triggered by this
     command changes to BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED, to indicate that the
     mirroring has ended and the destination now has a point-in-time
     copy tied to the time of the cancellation.

     For streaming, the image file retains its backing file unless the
     streaming operation happens to complete just as it is being
     cancelled.  A new streaming operation can be started at a later
     time to finish copying all data from the backing file.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.
     'force: boolean' (optional)
          If true, and the job has already emitted the event
          BLOCK_JOB_READY, abandon the job immediately (even if it is
          paused) instead of waiting for the destination to complete its
          final synchronization (since 1.3)

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: block-job-pause

     Pause an active background block operation.

     This command returns immediately after marking the active
     background block operation for pausing.  It is an error to call
     this command if no operation is in progress or if the job is
     already paused.

     The operation will pause as soon as possible.  No event is emitted
     when the operation is actually paused.  Cancelling a paused job
     automatically resumes it.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.3

 -- Command: block-job-resume

     Resume an active background block operation.

     This command returns immediately after resuming a paused background
     block operation.  It is an error to call this command if no
     operation is in progress or if the job is not paused.

     This command also clears the error status of the job.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.3

 -- Command: block-job-complete

     Manually trigger completion of an active background block
     operation.  This is supported for drive mirroring, where it also
     switches the device to write to the target path only.  The ability
     to complete is signaled with a BLOCK_JOB_READY event.

     This command completes an active background block operation
     synchronously.  The ordering of this command's return with the
     BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is not defined.  Note that if an I/O
     error occurs during the processing of this command: 1) the command
     itself will fail; 2) the error will be processed according to the
     rerror/werror arguments that were specified when starting the
     operation.

     A cancelled or paused job cannot be completed.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.3

 -- Command: block-job-dismiss

     For jobs that have already concluded, remove them from the
     block-job-query list.  This command only needs to be run for jobs
     which were started with QEMU 2.12+ job lifetime management
     semantics.

     This command will refuse to operate on any job that has not yet
     reached its terminal state, JOB_STATUS_CONCLUDED. For jobs that
     make use of the BLOCK_JOB_READY event, block-job-cancel or
     block-job-complete will still need to be used as appropriate.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier.

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 2.12

 -- Command: block-job-finalize

     Once a job that has manual=true reaches the pending state, it can
     be instructed to finalize any graph changes and do any necessary
     cleanup via this command.  For jobs in a transaction, instructing
     one job to finalize will force ALL jobs in the transaction to
     finalize, so it is only necessary to instruct a single member job
     to finalize.

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          The job identifier.

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 2.12

 -- Enum: BlockdevDiscardOptions

     Determines how to handle discard requests.

     Values:
     'ignore'
          Ignore the request
     'unmap'
          Forward as an unmap request

     Since: 2.9

 -- Enum: BlockdevDetectZeroesOptions

     Describes the operation mode for the automatic conversion of plain
     zero writes by the OS to driver specific optimized zero write
     commands.

     Values:

     Features:
     'dynamic-auto-read-only'
          If present, enabled auto-read-only means that the driver will
          open the image read-only at first, dynamically reopen the
          image file read-write when the first writer is attached to the
          node and reopen read-only when the last writer is detached.
          This allows giving QEMU write permissions only on demand when
          an operation actually needs write access.

 -- Command: x-blockdev-reopen

     Reopens a block device using the given set of options.  Any option
     not specified will be reset to its default value regardless of its
     previous status.  If an option cannot be changed or a particular
     driver does not support reopening then the command will return an
     error.

     The top-level 'node-name' option (from BlockdevOptions) must be
     specified and is used to select the block device to be reopened.
     Other 'node-name' options must be either omitted or set to the
     current name of the appropriate node.  This command won't change
     any node name and any attempt to do it will result in an error.

     In the case of options that refer to child nodes, the behavior of
     this command depends on the value:

     1) A set of options (BlockdevOptions): the child is reopened with
     the specified set of options.

     2) A reference to the current child: the child is reopened using
     its existing set of options.

     3) A reference to a different node: the current child is replaced
     with the specified one.

     4) NULL: the current child (if any) is detached.

     Options (1) and (2) are supported in all cases, but at the moment
     only 'backing' allows replacing or detaching an existing child.

     Unlike with blockdev-add, the 'backing' option must always be
     present unless the node being reopened does not have a backing file
     and its image does not have a default backing file name as part of
     its metadata.

     Arguments: the members of 'BlockdevOptions'

     Since: 4.0

 -- Command: blockdev-del

     Deletes a block device that has been added using blockdev-add.  The
     command will fail if the node is attached to a device or is
     otherwise being used.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          Name of the graph node to delete.

     Starts a job to create an image format on a given node.  The job is
     automatically finalized, but a manual job-dismiss is required.

     Arguments:
     'job-id: string'

 -- Command: blockdev-open-tray

     Opens a block device's tray.  If there is a block driver state tree
     inserted as a medium, it will become inaccessible to the guest (but
     it will remain associated to the block device, so closing the tray
     will make it accessible again).

     If the tray was already open before, this will be a no-op.

     Once the tray opens, a DEVICE_TRAY_MOVED event is emitted.  There
     are cases in which no such event will be generated, these include:
        - if the guest has locked the tray, 'force' is false and the
          guest does not respond to the eject request
        - if the BlockBackend denoted by 'device' does not have a guest
          device attached to it
        - if the guest device does not have an actual tray

     Arguments:
     'device: string' (optional)
          Block device name (deprecated, use 'id' instead)
     'id: string' (optional)
          The name or QOM path of the guest device (since: 2.8)
     'force: boolean' (optional)
          if false (the default), an eject request will be sent to the
          guest if it has locked the tray (and the tray will not be
          opened immediately); if true, the tray will be opened
          regardless of whether it is locked

 -- Event: BLOCK_IMAGE_CORRUPTED

     Emitted when a disk image is being marked corrupt.  The image can
     be identified by its device or node name.  The 'device' field is
     always present for compatibility reasons, but it can be empty ("")
     if the image does not have a device name associated.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          device name.  This is always present for compatibility
          reasons, but it can be empty ("") if the image does not have a
          device name associated.
     'node-name: string' (optional)
          node name (Since: 2.4)
     'msg: string'
          informative message for human consumption, such as the kind of
          corruption being detected.  It should not be parsed by machine
          as it is not guaranteed to be stable
     'offset: int' (optional)
          if the corruption resulted from an image access, this is the
          host's access offset into the image
     'size: int' (optional)
          if the corruption resulted from an image access, this is the
          access size
     'fatal: boolean'
          if set, the image is marked corrupt and therefore unusable
          after this event and must be repaired (Since 2.2; before,
          every BLOCK_IMAGE_CORRUPTED event was fatal)

     Note: If action is "stop", a STOP event will eventually follow the
     BLOCK_IO_ERROR event.

          device name associated.
     'node-name: string' (optional)
          node name.  Note that errors may be reported for the root node
          that is directly attached to a guest device rather than for
          the node where the error occurred.  The node name is not
          present if the drive is empty.  (Since: 2.8)
     'operation: IoOperationType'
          I/O operation
     'action: BlockErrorAction'
          action that has been taken
     'nospace: boolean' (optional)
          true if I/O error was caused due to a no-space condition.
          This key is only present if query-block's io-status is
          present, please see query-block documentation for more
          information (since: 2.2)
     'reason: string'
          human readable string describing the error cause.  (This field
          is a debugging aid for humans, it should not be parsed by
          applications) (since: 2.2)

     Note: If action is "stop", a STOP event will eventually follow the
     BLOCK_IO_ERROR event

          posix_fallocate() rather than writing zeros.
     'full'
          preallocate all data by writing zeros to device to ensure disk
          space is really available.  'full' preallocation also sets up
          metadata correctly.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Event: BLOCK_WRITE_THRESHOLD

     Emitted when writes on block device reaches or exceeds the
     configured write threshold.  For thin-provisioned devices, this
     means the device should be extended to avoid pausing for disk
     exhaustion.  The event is one shot.  Once triggered, it needs to be
     re-registered with another block-set-write-threshold command.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          graph node name on which the threshold was exceeded.
     'amount-exceeded: int'
          amount of data which exceeded the threshold, in bytes.
     'write-threshold: int'
          last configured threshold, in bytes.

     Since: 2.3

 -- Command: block-set-write-threshold

     Change the write threshold for a block drive.  An event will be
     delivered if a write to this block drive crosses the configured
     threshold.  The threshold is an offset, thus must be non-negative.
     Default is no write threshold.  Setting the threshold to zero
     disables it.

     This is useful to transparently resize thin-provisioned drives
     without the guest OS noticing.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          graph node name on which the threshold must be set.
     'write-threshold: int'
          configured threshold for the block device, bytes.  Use 0 to
          disable the threshold.

     Since: 2.3

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "block-set-write-threshold",
               "arguments": { "node-name": "mydev",
                              "write-threshold": 17179869184 } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: x-blockdev-change

     Dynamically reconfigure the block driver state graph.  It can be
     used to add, remove, insert or replace a graph node.  Currently
     only the Quorum driver implements this feature to add or remove its
     child.  This is useful to fix a broken quorum child.

     If 'node' is specified, it will be inserted under 'parent'.
     'child' may not be specified in this case.  If both 'parent' and
     'child' are specified but 'node' is not, 'child' will be detached
     from 'parent'.

     Arguments:
     'parent: string'
          the id or name of the parent node.
     'child: string' (optional)
          the name of a child under the given parent node.
     'node: string' (optional)
          the name of the node that will be added.

     Note: this command is experimental, and its API is not stable.  It
     does not support all kinds of operations, all kinds of children,
     nor all block drivers.

     FIXME Removing children from a quorum node means introducing gaps
     in the child indices.  This cannot be represented in the 'children'
     list of BlockdevOptionsQuorum, as returned by
     .bdrv_refresh_filename().

     Warning: The data in a new quorum child MUST be consistent with
     that of the rest of the array.

     Since: 2.7

     Example:
          1. Add a new node to a quorum
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-add",
               "arguments": {
                   "driver": "raw",
                   "node-name": "new_node",
                   "file": { "driver": "file",

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: x-blockdev-set-iothread

     Move 'node' and its children into the 'iothread'.  If 'iothread' is
     null then move 'node' and its children into the main loop.

     The node must not be attached to a BlockBackend.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          the name of the block driver node
     'iothread: StrOrNull'
          the name of the IOThread object or null for the main loop
     'force: boolean' (optional)
          true if the node and its children should be moved when a
          BlockBackend is already attached

     Note: this command is experimental and intended for test cases that
     need control over IOThreads only.

     Since: 2.12

     Example:
          1. Move a node into an IOThread
          -> { "execute": "x-blockdev-set-iothread",
               "arguments": { "node-name": "disk1",
                              "iothread": "iothread0" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

          2. Move a node into the main loop
          -> { "execute": "x-blockdev-set-iothread",
               "arguments": { "node-name": "disk1",

          <- { "return": {} }

1.7.3 Additional block stuff (VM related)
-----------------------------------------

 -- Enum: BiosAtaTranslation

     Policy that BIOS should use to interpret cylinder/head/sector
     addresses.  Note that Bochs BIOS and SeaBIOS will not actually
     translate logical CHS to physical; instead, they will use logical
     block addressing.

     Values:
     'auto'
          If cylinder/heads/sizes are passed, choose between none and
          LBA depending on the size of the disk.  If they are not
          passed, choose none if QEMU can guess that the disk had 16 or
          fewer heads, large if QEMU can guess that the disk had 131072
          or fewer tracks across all heads (i.e.
          cylinders*heads<131072), otherwise LBA.
     'none'
          The physical disk geometry is equal to the logical geometry.
     'lba'
          Assume 63 sectors per track and one of 16, 32, 64, 128 or 255
          heads (if fewer than 255 are enough to cover the whole disk
          with 1024 cylinders/head).  The number of cylinders/head is
          then computed based on the number of sectors and heads.
     'large'
          The number of cylinders per head is scaled down to 1024 by
          correspondingly scaling up the number of heads.
     'rechs'
          Same as 'large', but first convert a 16-head geometry to
          15-head, by proportionally scaling up the number of
          cylinders/head.

1.9 Dump guest memory
=====================

 -- Enum: DumpGuestMemoryFormat

     An enumeration of guest-memory-dump's format.

     Values:
     'elf'
          elf format
     'kdump-zlib'
          kdump-compressed format with zlib-compressed
     'kdump-lzo'
          kdump-compressed format with lzo-compressed
     'kdump-snappy'
          kdump-compressed format with snappy-compressed
     'win-dmp'
          Windows full crashdump format, can be used instead of ELF
          converting (since 2.13)

     Since: 2.0

 -- Command: dump-guest-memory

     Dump guest's memory to vmcore.  It is a synchronous operation that
     can take very long depending on the amount of guest memory.

     Arguments:
     'paging: boolean'
          if true, do paging to get guest's memory mapping.  This allows
          using gdb to process the core file.

          IMPORTANT: this option can make QEMU allocate several
          gigabytes of RAM. This can happen for a large guest, or a
          malicious guest pretending to be large.

          Also, paging=true has the following limitations:

            1. The guest may be in a catastrophic state or can have
               corrupted memory, which cannot be trusted
            2. The guest can be in real-mode even if paging is enabled.
               For example, the guest uses ACPI to sleep, and ACPI sleep
               state goes in real-mode
            3. Currently only supported on i386 and x86_64.

     'protocol: string'
          the filename or file descriptor of the vmcore.  The supported
          protocols are:

            1. file: the protocol starts with "file:", and the following
               string is the file's path.
            2. fd: the protocol starts with "fd:", and the following
               string is the fd's name.

     'detach: boolean' (optional)
          if true, QMP will return immediately rather than waiting for
          the dump to finish.  The user can track progress using
          "query-dump".  (since 2.6).
     'begin: int' (optional)
          if specified, the starting physical address.
     'length: int' (optional)
          if specified, the memory size, in bytes.  If you don't want to
          dump all guest's memory, please specify the start 'begin' and
          'length'
     'format: DumpGuestMemoryFormat' (optional)
          if specified, the format of guest memory dump.  But non-elf
          format is conflict with paging and filter, ie.  'paging',
          'begin' and 'length' is not allowed to be specified with
          non-elf 'format' at the same time (since 2.0)

     Note: All boolean arguments default to false

     Returns: nothing on success

     Since: 1.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "dump-guest-memory",
               "arguments": { "protocol": "fd:dump" } }

     'sysrq' was mistakenly added to hack around the fact that the ps2
     driver was not generating correct scancodes sequences when
     'alt+print' was pressed.  This flaw is now fixed and the 'sysrq'
     key serves no further purpose.  Any further use of 'sysrq' will be
     transparently changed to 'print', so they are effectively synonyms.

     of the same kind are added to the virtual machine and (b) you have
     configured input routing (see docs/multiseat.txt) for those input
     devices.  The parameters work exactly like the device and head
     properties of input devices.  If 'device' is missing, only devices
     that have no input routing config are admissible.  If 'device' is
     specified, both input devices with and without input routing config
     are admissible, but devices with input routing config take
     precedence.

 -- Enum: MigrationCapability

     Migration capabilities enumeration

     Values:
     'xbzrle'
          Migration supports xbzrle (Xor Based Zero Run Length
          Encoding).  This feature allows us to minimize migration
          traffic for certain work loads, by sending compressed
          difference of the pages
     'rdma-pin-all'
          Controls whether or not the entire VM memory footprint is
          mlock()'d on demand or all at once.  Refer to docs/rdma.txt
          for usage.  Disabled by default.  (since 2.0)
     'zero-blocks'
          During storage migration encode blocks of zeroes efficiently.
          This essentially saves 1MB of zeroes per block on the wire.
          Enabling requires source and target VM to support this
          feature.  To enable it is sufficient to enable the capability
          on the source VM. The feature is disabled by default.  (since
          1.6)
     'compress'
          Use multiple compression threads to accelerate live migration.
          This feature can help to reduce the migration traffic, by
          sending compressed pages.  Please note that if compress and
          xbzrle are both on, compress only takes effect in the ram bulk
          stage, after that, it will be disabled and only xbzrle takes
          effect, this can help to minimize migration traffic.  The
          feature is disabled by default.  (since 2.4 )
     'events'
          generate events for each migration state change (since 2.4 )
     'auto-converge'
          If enabled, QEMU will automatically throttle down the guest to
          speed up convergence of RAM migration.  (since 1.6)
     'postcopy-ram'
          Start executing on the migration target before all of RAM has
          been migrated, pulling the remaining pages along as needed.
          The capacity must have the same setting on both source and
          target or migration will not even start.  NOTE: If the
          migration fails during postcopy the VM will fail.  (since 2.6)
     'x-colo'
          If enabled, migration will never end, and the state of the VM
          on the primary side will be migrated continuously to the VM on
          secondary side, this process is called COarse-Grain LOck
          Stepping (COLO) for Non-stop Service.  (since 2.8)
     'release-ram'
          if enabled, qemu will free the migrated ram pages on the
          source during postcopy-ram migration.  (since 2.9)
     'block'
          If enabled, QEMU will also migrate the contents of all block
          devices.  Default is disabled.  A possible alternative uses
          mirror jobs to a builtin NBD server on the destination, which
          offers more flexibility.  (Since 2.10)
     'return-path'
          If enabled, migration will use the return path even for
          precopy.  (since 2.10)
     'pause-before-switchover'
          Pause outgoing migration before serialising device state and
          before disabling block IO (since 2.11)
     'multifd'
          Use more than one fd for migration (since 4.0)
     'dirty-bitmaps'
          If enabled, QEMU will migrate named dirty bitmaps.  (since
          2.12)
     'postcopy-blocktime'
          Calculate downtime for postcopy live migration (since 3.0)
     'late-block-activate'
          If enabled, the destination will not activate block devices
          (and thus take locks) immediately at the end of migration.
          (since 3.0)
     'x-ignore-shared'
          If enabled, QEMU will not migrate shared memory (since 4.0)

     'announce-step'
          Increase in delay (in milliseconds) between subsequent packets
          in the announcement (Since 4.0)
     'compress-level'
          Set the compression level to be used in live migration, the
          compression level is an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means
          no compression, 1 means the best compression speed, and 9
          means best compression ratio which will consume more CPU.
     'compress-threads'
          Set compression thread count to be used in live migration, the
          compression thread count is an integer between 1 and 255.
     'compress-wait-thread'
          Controls behavior when all compression threads are currently
          busy.  If true (default), wait for a free compression thread
          to become available; otherwise, send the page uncompressed.
          (Since 3.1)
     'decompress-threads'
          Set decompression thread count to be used in live migration,
          the decompression thread count is an integer between 1 and
          255.  Usually, decompression is at least 4 times as fast as
          compression, so set the decompress-threads to the number about
          1/4 of compress-threads is adequate.
     'cpu-throttle-initial'
          Initial percentage of time guest cpus are throttled when
          migration auto-converge is activated.  The default value is
          20.  (Since 2.7)
     'cpu-throttle-increment'

     'tls-creds'
          ID of the 'tls-creds' object that provides credentials for
          establishing a TLS connection over the migration data channel.
          On the outgoing side of the migration, the credentials must be
          for a 'client' endpoint, while for the incoming side the
          credentials must be for a 'server' endpoint.  Setting this
          will enable TLS for all migrations.  The default is unset,
          resulting in unsecured migration at the QEMU level.  (Since
          2.7)
     'tls-hostname'
          hostname of the target host for the migration.  This is
          required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
          migration URI does not already include a hostname.  For
          example if using fd: or exec: based migration, the hostname
          must be provided so that the server's x509 certificate
          identity can be validated.  (Since 2.7)
     'tls-authz'
          ID of the 'authz' object subclass that provides access control
          checking of the TLS x509 certificate distinguished name.  This
          object is only resolved at time of use, so can be deleted and
          recreated on the fly while the migration server is active.  If

          periodic mode.  (Since 2.8)
     'block-incremental'
          Affects how much storage is migrated when the block migration
          capability is enabled.  When false, the entire storage backing
          chain is migrated into a flattened image at the destination;
          when true, only the active qcow2 layer is migrated and the
          destination must already have access to the same backing chain
          as was used on the source.  (since 2.10)
     'multifd-channels'
          Number of channels used to migrate data in parallel.  This is

          rather than TLS (Since 2.9) Previously (since 2.7), this was
          reported by omitting tls-creds instead.
     'tls-hostname: StrOrNull' (optional)
          hostname of the target host for the migration.  This is
          required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
          migration URI does not already include a hostname.  For
          example if using fd: or exec: based migration, the hostname
          must be provided so that the server's x509 certificate
          identity can be validated.  (Since 2.7) An empty string means
          that QEMU will use the hostname associated with the migration
          URI, if any.  (Since 2.9) Previously (since 2.7), this was
          reported by omitting tls-hostname instead.

     'block-incremental: boolean' (optional)
          Affects how much storage is migrated when the block migration
          capability is enabled.  When false, the entire storage backing
          chain is migrated into a flattened image at the destination;
          when true, only the active qcow2 layer is migrated and the
          destination must already have access to the same backing chain
          as was used on the source.  (since 2.10)
     'multifd-channels: int' (optional)
          Number of channels used to migrate data in parallel.  This is

     Returns: nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes:
       1. The 'query-migrate' command should be used to check
          migration's progress and final result (this information is
          provided by the 'status' member)

       2. All boolean arguments default to false

       3. The user Monitor's "detach" argument is invalid in QMP and

     Notes:
       1. It's a bad idea to use a string for the uri, but it needs to
          stay compatible with -incoming and the format of the uri is
          already exposed above libvirt.

       2. QEMU must be started with -incoming defer to allow
          migrate-incoming to be used.

       3. The uri format is the same as for -incoming

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "migrate-incoming",

          field to get last colo mode.  (since 4.0)
     'reason: COLOExitReason'
          describes the reason for the COLO exit.

     Since: 3.1

1.17 Transactions
=================

 -- Object: Abort

     This action can be used to test transaction failure.

     Since: 1.6

 -- Enum: ActionCompletionMode

     An enumeration of Transactional completion modes.

     Values:
     'individual'
          Do not attempt to cancel any other Actions if any Actions fail
          after the Transaction request succeeds.  All Actions that can
          complete successfully will do so without waiting on others.
          This is the default.
     'grouped'
          If any Action fails after the Transaction succeeds, cancel all
          Actions.  Actions do not complete until all Actions are ready
          to complete.  May be rejected by Actions that do not support
          this completion mode.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Object: TransactionAction

     A discriminated record of operations that can be performed with
     'transaction'.  Action 'type' can be:

        - 'abort': since 1.6
        - 'block-dirty-bitmap-add': since 2.5
        - 'block-dirty-bitmap-clear': since 2.5
        - 'block-dirty-bitmap-enable': since 4.0

        - 'blockdev-snapshot-sync': since 1.1
        - 'drive-backup': since 1.6

     Members:

          One of "abort", "block-dirty-bitmap-add",
          "block-dirty-bitmap-clear", "block-dirty-bitmap-enable",
          "block-dirty-bitmap-disable", "block-dirty-bitmap-merge",
          "blockdev-backup", "blockdev-snapshot",
          "blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync", "blockdev-snapshot-sync",
          "drive-backup"
     'data: Abort' when 'type' is "abort"
     'data: BlockDirtyBitmapAdd' when 'type' is "block-dirty-bitmap-add"
     'data: BlockDirtyBitmap' when 'type' is "block-dirty-bitmap-clear"

     'data: DriveBackup' when 'type' is "drive-backup"

     Since: 1.1

 -- Object: TransactionProperties

     Optional arguments to modify the behavior of a Transaction.

     Members:
     'completion-mode: ActionCompletionMode' (optional)
          Controls how jobs launched asynchronously by Actions will
          complete or fail as a group.  See 'ActionCompletionMode' for
          details.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Command: transaction

     Executes a number of transactionable QMP commands atomically.  If
     any operation fails, then the entire set of actions will be
     abandoned and the appropriate error returned.

     For external snapshots, the dictionary contains the device, the
     file to use for the new snapshot, and the format.  The default
     format, if not specified, is qcow2.

     Each new snapshot defaults to being created by QEMU (wiping any
     contents if the file already exists), but it is also possible to
     reuse an externally-created file.  In the latter case, you should
     ensure that the new image file has the same contents as the current
     one; QEMU cannot perform any meaningful check.  Typically this is
     achieved by using the current image file as the backing file for
     the new image.

     On failure, the original disks pre-snapshot attempt will be used.

     For internal snapshots, the dictionary contains the device and the
     snapshot's name.  If an internal snapshot matching name already
     exists, the request will be rejected.  Only some image formats
     support it, for example, qcow2, rbd, and sheepdog.

     On failure, qemu will try delete the newly created internal
     snapshot in the transaction.  When an I/O error occurs during
     deletion, the user needs to fix it later with qemu-img or other
     command.

     Arguments:
     'actions: array of TransactionAction'
          List of 'TransactionAction'; information needed for the
          respective operations.
     'properties: TransactionProperties' (optional)
          structure of additional options to control the execution of
          the transaction.  See 'TransactionProperties' for additional
          detail.

     Returns: nothing on success

     Errors depend on the operations of the transaction

     Note: The transaction aborts on the first failure.  Therefore,
     there will be information on only one failed operation returned in
     an error condition, and subsequent actions will not have been
     attempted.

     Since: 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "transaction",
               "arguments": { "actions": [
                   { "type": "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "data" : { "device": "ide-hd0",
                                               "snapshot-file": "/some/place/my-image",
                                               "format": "qcow2" } },
                   { "type": "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "data" : { "node-name": "myfile",
                                               "snapshot-file": "/some/place/my-image2",
                                               "snapshot-node-name": "node3432",
                                               "mode": "existing",

                                               "name": "snapshot0" } } ] } }
          <- { "return": {} }

1.18 Tracing
============

 -- Enum: TraceEventState

     State of a tracing event.

     Values:
     'unavailable'
          The event is statically disabled.
     'disabled'
          The event is dynamically disabled.
     'enabled'
          The event is dynamically enabled.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Object: TraceEventInfo

     Information of a tracing event.

     Members:
     'name: string'
          Event name.
     'state: TraceEventState'
          Tracing state.
     'vcpu: boolean'
          Whether this is a per-vCPU event (since 2.7).
     An event is per-vCPU if it has the "vcpu" property in the
     "trace-events" files.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Command: trace-event-get-state

     Query the state of events.

     Arguments:
     'name: string'
          Event name pattern (case-sensitive glob).
     'vcpu: int' (optional)
          The vCPU to query (any by default; since 2.7).

     Returns: a list of 'TraceEventInfo' for the matching events

     An event is returned if:
        - its name matches the 'name' pattern, and
        - if 'vcpu' is given, the event has the "vcpu" property.

     Therefore, if 'vcpu' is given, the operation will only match
     per-vCPU events, returning their state on the specified vCPU.
     Special case: if 'name' is an exact match, 'vcpu' is given and the
     event does not have the "vcpu" property, an error is returned.

     Since: 2.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "trace-event-get-state",
               "arguments": { "name": "qemu_memalign" } }
          <- { "return": [ { "name": "qemu_memalign", "state": "disabled" } ] }

 -- Command: trace-event-set-state

     Set the dynamic tracing state of events.

     Arguments:
     'name: string'
          Event name pattern (case-sensitive glob).
     'enable: boolean'
          Whether to enable tracing.
     'ignore-unavailable: boolean' (optional)
          Do not match unavailable events with 'name'.
     'vcpu: int' (optional)
          The vCPU to act upon (all by default; since 2.7).
     An event's state is modified if:
        - its name matches the 'name' pattern, and
        - if 'vcpu' is given, the event has the "vcpu" property.

     Therefore, if 'vcpu' is given, the operation will only match
     per-vCPU events, setting their state on the specified vCPU. Special
     case: if 'name' is an exact match, 'vcpu' is given and the event
     does not have the "vcpu" property, an error is returned.

     Since: 2.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "trace-event-set-state",
               "arguments": { "name": "qemu_memalign", "enable": "true" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

1.19 QMP introspection
======================

 -- Command: query-qmp-schema

     Command query-qmp-schema exposes the QMP wire ABI as an array of
     SchemaInfo.  This lets QMP clients figure out what commands and
     events are available in this QEMU, and their parameters and
     results.

     However, the SchemaInfo can't reflect all the rules and
     restrictions that apply to QMP. It's interface introspection
     (figuring out what's there), not interface specification.  The
     specification is in the QAPI schema.

     Furthermore, while we strive to keep the QMP wire format
     backwards-compatible across qemu versions, the introspection output
     is not guaranteed to have the same stability.  For example, one
     version of qemu may list an object member as an optional
     non-variant, while another lists the same member only through the
     object's variants; or the type of a member may change from a
     generic string into a specific enum or from one specific type into
     an alternate that includes the original type alongside something
     else.

     Returns: array of 'SchemaInfo', where each element describes an
     entity in the ABI: command, event, type, ...

     The order of the various SchemaInfo is unspecified; however, all
     names are guaranteed to be unique (no name will be duplicated with
     different meta-types).

     Note: the QAPI schema is also used to help define *internal*
     interfaces, by defining QAPI types.  These are not part of the QMP
     wire ABI, and therefore not returned by this command.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Enum: SchemaMetaType

     This is a 'SchemaInfo''s meta type, i.e.  the kind of entity it
     describes.

     Values:
     'builtin'
          a predefined type such as 'int' or 'bool'.
     'enum'
          an enumeration type
     'array'
          an array type
     'object'
          an object type (struct or union)
     'alternate'
          an alternate type
     'command'
          a QMP command
     'event'
          a QMP event

     Since: 2.5

 -- Object: SchemaInfo

     Members:
     'name: string'
          the entity's name, inherited from 'base'.  The SchemaInfo is
          always referenced by this name.  Commands and events have the
          name defined in the QAPI schema.  Unlike command and event
          names, type names are not part of the wire ABI. Consequently,
          type names are meaningless strings here, although they are
          still guaranteed unique regardless of 'meta-type'.
     'meta-type: SchemaMetaType'
          the entity's meta type, inherited from 'base'.
     The members of 'SchemaInfoBuiltin' when 'meta-type' is "builtin"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoEnum' when 'meta-type' is "enum"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoArray' when 'meta-type' is "array"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoObject' when 'meta-type' is "object"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoAlternate' when 'meta-type' is "alternate"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoCommand' when 'meta-type' is "command"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoEvent' when 'meta-type' is "event"
     Additional members depend on the value of 'meta-type'.

     Members:
     'members: array of SchemaInfoObjectMember'
          the object type's (non-variant) members, in no particular
          order.
     'tag: string' (optional)
          the name of the member serving as type tag.  An element of
          'members' with this name must exist.
     'variants: array of SchemaInfoObjectVariant' (optional)
          variant members, i.e.  additional members that depend on the
          type tag's value.  Present exactly when 'tag' is present.  The
          variants are in no particular order, and may even differ from
          the order of the values of the enum type of the 'tag'.
     'features: array of string' (optional)
          names of features associated with the type, in no particular

          The parameter is optional, and behavior when it's missing is
          not specified here.  Future extension: if present and
          non-null, the parameter is optional, and defaults to this
          value.

     Since: 2.5

     Members:
     'case: string'
          a value of the type tag.

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: qom-list

     This command will list any properties of a object given a path in
     the object model.

     Arguments:
     'path: string'
          the path within the object model.  See 'qom-get' for a
          description of this parameter.

     Returns: a list of 'ObjectPropertyInfo' that describe the
     properties of the object.

     Since: 1.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "qom-list",
               "arguments": { "path": "/chardevs" } }
          <- { "return": [ { "name": "type", "type": "string" },

 -- Command: qom-get

     This command will get a property from a object model path and
     return the value.

     Arguments:
     'path: string'
          The path within the object model.  There are two forms of
          supported paths-absolute and partial paths.

          Absolute paths are derived from the root object and can follow
          child<> or link<> properties.  Since they can follow link<>
          properties, they can be arbitrarily long.  Absolute paths look
          like absolute filenames and are prefixed with a leading slash.

          Partial paths look like relative filenames.  They do not begin
          with a prefix.  The matching rules for partial paths are
          subtle but designed to make specifying objects easy.  At each
          level of the composition tree, the partial path is matched as
          an absolute path.  The first match is not returned.  At least
          two matches are searched for.  A successful result is only
          returned if only one match is found.  If more than one match
          is found, a flag is return to indicate that the match was
          ambiguous.
     'property: string'
          The property name to read

     Returns: The property value.  The type depends on the property
     type.  child<> and link<> properties are returned as #str
     pathnames.  All integer property types (u8, u16, etc) are returned
     as #int.

     Since: 1.2

     Example:
          1. Use absolute path

          -> { "execute": "qom-get",

     Note: objects can create properties at runtime, for example to
     describe links between different devices and/or objects.  These
     properties are not included in the output of this command.

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: device_add

     Arguments:
     'driver: string'
          the name of the new device's driver
     'bus: string' (optional)
          the device's parent bus (device tree path)
     'id: string' (optional)
          the device's ID, must be unique
     Additional arguments depend on the type.

     Add a device.

     Notes:
       1. For detailed information about this command, please refer to
          the 'docs/qdev-device-use.txt' file.

       2. It's possible to list device properties by running QEMU with
          the "-device DEVICE,help" command-line argument, where DEVICE
          is the device's name

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "device_add",
               "arguments": { "driver": "e1000", "id": "net1",
                              "bus": "pci.0",

          <- { "return": {} }

     TODO: This command effectively bypasses QAPI completely due to its
     "additional arguments" business.  It shouldn't have been added to
     the schema in this form.  It should be qapified properly, or
     replaced by a properly qapified command.

     Since: 0.13

 -- Command: device_del

     Remove a device from a guest

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          the device's ID or QOM path

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'id' is not a valid device,
     DeviceNotFound

     Notes: When this command completes, the device may not be removed
     from the guest.  Hot removal is an operation that requires guest
     cooperation.  This command merely requests that the guest begin the
     hot removal process.  Completion of the device removal process is
     signaled with a DEVICE_DELETED event.  Guest reset will
     automatically complete removal for all devices.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "device_del",
               "arguments": { "id": "net1" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

          -> { "execute": "device_del",
               "arguments": { "id": "/machine/peripheral-anon/device[0]" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Event: DEVICE_DELETED

     Emitted whenever the device removal completion is acknowledged by
     the guest.  At this point, it's safe to reuse the specified device
     ID. Device removal can be initiated by the guest or by HMP/QMP
     commands.

     Arguments:
     'device: string' (optional)
          device name
     'path: string'
          device path

     Since: 1.5

     Example:
          <- { "event": "DEVICE_DELETED",
               "data": { "device": "virtio-net-pci-0",
                         "path": "/machine/peripheral/virtio-net-pci-0" },

 -- Command: query-cpus

     Returns a list of information about each virtual CPU.

     This command causes vCPU threads to exit to userspace, which causes
     a small interruption to guest CPU execution.  This will have a
     negative impact on realtime guests and other latency sensitive
     guest workloads.  It is recommended to use 'query-cpus-fast'
     instead of this command to avoid the vCPU interruption.

     Returns: a list of 'CpuInfo' for each virtual CPU

 -- Object: CpuModelInfo

     Virtual CPU model.

     A CPU model consists of the name of a CPU definition, to which
     delta changes are applied (e.g.  features added/removed).  Most
     magic values that an architecture might require should be hidden
     behind the name.  However, if required, architectures can expose
     relevant properties.

     Members:
     'name: string'
          the name of the CPU definition the model is based on
     'props: value' (optional)
          a dictionary of QOM properties to be applied

     Since: 2.8.0

 -- Enum: CpuModelExpansionType

     An enumeration of CPU model expansion types.

     Values:
     'static'
          Expand to a static CPU model, a combination of a static base
          model name and property delta changes.  As the static base
          model will never change, the expanded CPU model will be the
          same, independent of QEMU version, machine type, machine
          options, and accelerator options.  Therefore, the resulting
          model can be used by tooling without having to specify a
          compatibility machine - e.g.  when displaying the "host"
          model.  The 'static' CPU models are migration-safe.
     'full'
          Expand all properties.  The produced model is not guaranteed
          to be migration-safe, but allows tooling to get an insight and
          work with model details.

     Note: When a non-migration-safe CPU model is expanded in static
     mode, some features enabled by the CPU model may be omitted,
     because they can't be implemented by a static CPU model definition
     (e.g.  cache info passthrough and PMU passthrough in x86).  If you
     need an accurate representation of the features enabled by a
     non-migration-safe CPU model, use 'full'.  If you need a static
     representation that will keep ABI compatibility even when changing
     QEMU version or machine-type, use 'static' (but keep in mind that
     some features may be omitted).

     Since: 2.8.0

 -- Enum: CpuModelCompareResult

     An enumeration of CPU model comparison results.  The result is
     usually calculated using e.g.  CPU features or CPU generations.

     Values:
     'incompatible'
          If model A is incompatible to model B, model A is not
          guaranteed to run where model B runs and the other way around.
     'identical'
          If model A is identical to model B, model A is guaranteed to
          run where model B runs and the other way around.
     'superset'
          If model A is a superset of model B, model B is guaranteed to
          run where model A runs.  There are no guarantees about the
          other way.
     'subset'
          If model A is a subset of model B, model A is guaranteed to
          run where model B runs.  There are no guarantees about the
          other way.

          List of properties that led to the comparison result not being
          identical.
     'responsible-properties' is a list of QOM property names that led
     to both CPUs not being detected as identical.  For identical
     models, this list is empty.  If a QOM property is read-only, that
     means there's no known way to make the CPU models identical.  If
     the special property name "type" is included, the models are by
     definition not identical and cannot be made identical.

 -- Command: query-cpu-model-comparison

     Compares two CPU models, returning how they compare in a specific
     configuration.  The results indicates how both models compare
     regarding runnability.  This result can be used by tooling to make
     decisions if a certain CPU model will run in a certain
     configuration or if a compatible CPU model has to be created by
     baselining.

     Usually, a CPU model is compared against the maximum possible CPU
     model of a certain configuration (e.g.  the "host" model for KVM).
     If that CPU model is identical or a subset, it will run in that
     configuration.

     The result returned by this command may be affected by:

        * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the
          QEMU version.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the
          machine-type.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine options (including accelerator): in some
          architectures, CPU models may look different depending on
          machine and accelerator options.  (Except for CPU models
          reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
        * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu
          option and global properties may affect expansion of CPU
          models.  Using query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is
          not advised.

     Some architectures may not support comparing CPU models.  s390x
     supports comparing CPU models.

     Arguments:
     'modela: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented
     'modelb: CpuModelInfo'

     Returns: a CpuModelBaselineInfo.  Returns an error if comparing CPU
     models is not supported, if a model cannot be used, if a model
     contains an unknown cpu definition name, unknown properties or
     properties with wrong types.

     Note: this command isn't specific to s390x, but is only implemented
     on this architecture currently.

     If: 'defined(TARGET_S390X)'

 -- Command: query-cpu-model-baseline

     Baseline two CPU models, creating a compatible third model.  The
     created model will always be a static, migration-safe CPU model
     (see "static" CPU model expansion for details).

     This interface can be used by tooling to create a compatible CPU
     model out two CPU models.  The created CPU model will be identical
     to or a subset of both CPU models when comparing them.  Therefore,
     the created CPU model is guaranteed to run where the given CPU
     models run.

     The result returned by this command may be affected by:

        * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the
          QEMU version.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the
          machine-type.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine options (including accelerator): in some
          architectures, CPU models may look different depending on
          machine and accelerator options.  (Except for CPU models
          reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
        * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu
          option and global properties may affect expansion of CPU
          models.  Using query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is
          not advised.

     Some architectures may not support baselining CPU models.  s390x
     supports baselining CPU models.

     Arguments:
     'modela: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented
     'modelb: CpuModelInfo'

     additional options) to different granularities, allowing tooling to
     get an understanding what a specific CPU model looks like in QEMU
     under a certain configuration.

     This interface can be used to query the "host" CPU model.

     The data returned by this command may be affected by:

        * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the
          QEMU version.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the

        * machine options (including accelerator): in some
          architectures, CPU models may look different depending on
          machine and accelerator options.  (Except for CPU models
          reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
        * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu
          option and global properties may affect expansion of CPU
          models.  Using query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is
          not advised.

     Some architectures may not support all expansion types.  s390x

          whether a CPU definition can be safely used for migration in
          combination with a QEMU compatibility machine when migrating
          between different QEMU versions and between hosts with
          different sets of (hardware or software) capabilities.  If not
          provided, information is not available and callers should not
          assume the CPU definition to be migration-safe.  (since 2.8)
     'static: boolean'
          whether a CPU definition is static and will not change
          depending on QEMU version, machine type, machine options and
          accelerator options.  A static model is always migration-safe.

     'alias-of: string' (optional)
          Name of CPU model this model is an alias for.  The target of
          the CPU model alias may change depending on the machine type.
          Management software is supposed to translate CPU model aliases
          in the VM configuration, because aliases may stop being
          migration-safe in the future (since 4.1)
     'unavailable-features' is a list of QOM property names that
     represent CPU model attributes that prevent the CPU from running.
     If the QOM property is read-only, that means there's no known way
     to make the CPU model run in the current host.  Implementations
     that choose not to provide specific information return the property
     name "type".  If the property is read-write, it means that it MAY
     be possible to run the CPU model in the current host if that
     property is changed.  Management software can use it as hints to
     suggest or choose an alternative for the user, or just to generate
     meaningful error messages explaining why the CPU model can't be
     used.  If 'unavailable-features' is an empty list, the CPU model is
     runnable using the current host and machine-type.  If
     'unavailable-features' is not present, runnability information for
     the CPU is not available.

          client must not enable any capability that is not mentioned in
          the QMP greeting message.  If the field is not provided, it
          means no QMP capabilities will be enabled.  (since 2.12)

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "qmp_capabilities",
               "arguments": { "enable": [ "oob" ] } }
          <- { "return": {} }

     Notes: This command is valid exactly when first connecting: it must
     be issued before any other command will be accepted, and will fail
     once the monitor is accepting other commands.  (see qemu
     docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt)

     The QMP client needs to explicitly enable QMP capabilities,
     otherwise all the QMP capabilities will be turned off by default.

     Since: 0.13

          The version of QEMU. By current convention, a micro version of
          50 signifies a development branch.  A micro version greater
          than or equal to 90 signifies a release candidate for the next
          minor version.  A micro version of less than 50 signifies a
          stable release.
     'package: string'
          QEMU will always set this field to an empty string.
          Downstream versions of QEMU should set this to a non-empty

             }

     Note: This example has been shortened as the real response is too
     long.

 -- Command: quit

     This command will cause the QEMU process to exit gracefully.  While
     every attempt is made to send the QMP response before terminating,
     this is not guaranteed.  When using this interface, a premature EOF
     would not be unexpected.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "quit" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: stop

     Stop all guest VCPU execution.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: This function will succeed even if the guest is already in
     the stopped state.  In "inmigrate" state, it will ensure that the
     guest remains paused once migration finishes, as if the -S option
     was passed on the command line.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "stop" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: system_reset

     Performs a hard reset of a guest.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "system_reset" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: system_powerdown

     Requests that a guest perform a powerdown operation.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: A guest may or may not respond to this command.  This
     command returning does not indicate that a guest has accepted the
     request or that it has shut down.  Many guests will respond to this
     command by prompting the user in some way.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "system_powerdown" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: memsave

     Save a portion of guest memory to a file.

     Arguments:
     'val: int'
          the virtual address of the guest to start from
     'size: int'
          the size of memory region to save
     'filename: string'
          the file to save the memory to as binary data
     'cpu-index: int' (optional)
          the index of the virtual CPU to use for translating the
          virtual address (defaults to CPU 0)

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Errors were not reliably returned until 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "memsave",
               "arguments": { "val": 10,
                              "size": 100,
                              "filename": "/tmp/virtual-mem-dump" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: pmemsave

     Save a portion of guest physical memory to a file.

     Arguments:
     'val: int'
          the physical address of the guest to start from
     'size: int'
          the size of memory region to save
     'filename: string'
          the file to save the memory to as binary data

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Errors were not reliably returned until 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "pmemsave",
               "arguments": { "val": 10,
                              "size": 100,
                              "filename": "/tmp/physical-mem-dump" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: cont

     Resume guest VCPU execution.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Returns: If successful, nothing

     Notes: This command will succeed if the guest is currently running.
     It will also succeed if the guest is in the "inmigrate" state; in
     this case, the effect of the command is to make sure the guest
     starts once migration finishes, removing the effect of the -S
     command line option if it was passed.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "cont" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: x-exit-preconfig

     Exit from "preconfig" state

     This command makes QEMU exit the preconfig state and proceed with
     VM initialization using configuration data provided on the command
     line and via the QMP monitor during the preconfig state.  The
     command is only available during the preconfig state (i.e.  when
     the -preconfig command line option was in use).

     Since 3.0

     Returns: nothing

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "x-exit-preconfig" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: system_wakeup

     Wake up guest from suspend.  If the guest has wake-up from suspend
     support enabled (wakeup-suspend-support flag from
     query-current-machine), wake-up guest from suspend if the guest is
     in SUSPENDED state.  Return an error otherwise.

     Since: 1.1

     Returns: nothing.

     Note: prior to 4.0, this command does nothing in case the guest
     isn't suspended.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "system_wakeup" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: inject-nmi

     Injects a Non-Maskable Interrupt into the default CPU (x86/s390) or
     all CPUs (ppc64).  The command fails when the guest doesn't support
     injecting.

     Returns: If successful, nothing

     Since: 0.14.0

     Note: prior to 2.1, this command was only supported for x86 and
     s390 VMs

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "inject-nmi" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: balloon

     Request the balloon driver to change its balloon size.

     Arguments:
     'value: int'
          the target size of the balloon in bytes

     Returns: Nothing on success If the balloon driver is enabled but
     not functional because the KVM kernel module cannot support it,
     KvmMissingCap If no balloon device is present, DeviceNotActive

     Notes: This command just issues a request to the guest.  When it
     returns, the balloon size may not have changed.  A guest can change
     the balloon size independent of this command.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "balloon", "arguments": { "value": 536870912 } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: human-monitor-command

     Execute a command on the human monitor and return the output.

     Arguments:
     'command-line: string'
          the command to execute in the human monitor
     'cpu-index: int' (optional)
          The CPU to use for commands that require an implicit CPU

     Returns: the output of the command as a string

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: This command only exists as a stop-gap.  Its use is highly
     discouraged.  The semantics of this command are not guaranteed:
     this means that command names, arguments and responses can change
     or be removed at ANY time.  Applications that rely on long term
     stability guarantees should NOT use this command.

     Known limitations:

        * This command is stateless, this means that commands that
          depend on state information (such as getfd) might not work

        * Commands that prompt the user for data don't currently work

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "human-monitor-command",
               "arguments": { "command-line": "info kvm" } }
          <- { "return": "kvm support: enabled\r\n" }

 -- Command: change

     This command is multiple commands multiplexed together.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          This is normally the name of a block device but it may also be
          'vnc'.  when it's 'vnc', then sub command depends on 'target'
     'target: string'
          If 'device' is a block device, then this is the new filename.
          If 'device' is 'vnc', then if the value 'password' selects the
          vnc change password command.  Otherwise, this specifies a new
          server URI address to listen to for VNC connections.
     'arg: string' (optional)
          If 'device' is a block device, then this is an optional format
          to open the device with.  If 'device' is 'vnc' and 'target' is
          'password', this is the new VNC password to set.  See
          change-vnc-password for additional notes.

     Returns: Nothing on success.  If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, DeviceNotFound

     Notes: This interface is deprecated, and it is strongly recommended
     that you avoid using it.  For changing block devices, use
     blockdev-change-medium; for changing VNC parameters, use
     change-vnc-password.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          1. Change a removable medium

          -> { "execute": "change",
               "arguments": { "device": "ide1-cd0",
                              "target": "/srv/images/Fedora-12-x86_64-DVD.iso" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

          2. Change VNC password

          -> { "execute": "change",
               "arguments": { "device": "vnc", "target": "password",
                              "arg": "foobar1" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: xen-set-global-dirty-log

     Enable or disable the global dirty log mode.

     Arguments:
     'enable: boolean'
          true to enable, false to disable.

     Returns: nothing

     Since: 1.3

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "xen-set-global-dirty-log",
               "arguments": { "enable": true } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: getfd

     Receive a file descriptor via SCM rights and assign it a name

     Arguments:
     'fdname: string'
          file descriptor name

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: If 'fdname' already exists, the file descriptor assigned to
     it will be closed and replaced by the received file descriptor.

     The 'closefd' command can be used to explicitly close the file
     descriptor when it is no longer needed.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "getfd", "arguments": { "fdname": "fd1" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: closefd

     Close a file descriptor previously passed via SCM rights

     Arguments:
     'fdname: string'
          file descriptor name

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Since: 2.11.0

 -- Command: query-memory-size-summary

     Return the amount of initially allocated and present hotpluggable
     (if enabled) memory in bytes.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "query-memory-size-summary" }
          <- { "return": { "base-memory": 4294967296, "plugged-memory": 0 } }

     order.  If both are omitted, 'data' is implied.

     Other fields / optargs can be used to override fields of the
     generic ACPI table header; refer to the ACPI specification 5.0,
     section 5.2.6 System Description Table Header.  If a header field
     is not overridden, then the corresponding value from the
     concatenated blob is used (in case of 'file'), or it is filled in
     with a hard-coded value (in case of 'data').

     String fields are copied into the matching ACPI member from lowest
     address upwards, and silently truncated / NUL-padded to length.
