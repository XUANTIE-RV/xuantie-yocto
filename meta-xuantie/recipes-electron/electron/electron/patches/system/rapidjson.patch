description: build against debian's rapidjson-dev package
author: Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>

Due to some questionable licensing (the JSON "do not use this for evil" license),
debian deletes all of third_party/angle/third_party/rapidjson even though a small
portion of it falls under that license. The library is tiny and doesn't change
much, so this lets chromium build against the system's rapidjson-dev header files.
